    <img src="../images/general-tsos.jpeg" alt="general-tso-chicken">

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>General Tso's (pronounced tsow) chicken is a Chinese-American dish that features deep-fried chicken tossed in an
        irresistibly sticky glaze made with garlic, sugar, soy sauce, and chiles. The dish is named after 19th-century
        military leader Tso Tsung-t'ang.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>For Chicken:</h4>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 Â½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 pinch white pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup cornstarch</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <h4>For Sauce:</h4>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons chopped green onion</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>6 dried whole red chilies</li>
            <li>1 strip orange zest</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare sauce: Heat vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan
            to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Whisk egg in large mixing bowl. Add chicken, salt, sugar, and pepper; mix well. Mix in cornstarch, a little
            bit at a time, until chicken is well coated.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, carefully drop one piece of chicken at a time into the hot oil. Fry until chicken turns
            golden brown and begins to float, about 3 minutes. Remove chicken to a plate and allow to cool as you fry
            the next batch.</li>
        <li>Once all of the chicken has been fried, refry the chicken, starting with the batch that was cooked first.
            Fry each batch until chicken turns deep golden brown, about 2 minutes more. Drain on a paper towel-lined
            plate.</li>
        <li>Prepare sauce: Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Stir in green onion, garlic,
            whole chiles, and orange zest. Cook and stir until garlic turns golden and chiles brighten, 1 to 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add sugar, soy sauce, chicken broth, peanut oil, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and ginger; bring to a boil and
            cook for 3 minutes. Whisk 2 teaspoons of cornstarch in water until dissolved. Stir into the boiling sauce.
            Return to a boil and cook until the sauce thickens and is no longer cloudy from the cornstarch, about 1
            minute.</li>
        <li>Stir chicken into the boiling sauce. Reduce heat to low and cook until chicken is heated through and has
            absorbed some of the sauce, about 3 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
